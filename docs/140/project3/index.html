                <p>Chanukah, also commonly spelled Hanukkah, is an 8 day long Jewish holiday celebrating the recovery
                    of the temple in Jerusalem around 200 BCE, having been conquered by the Greeks about a century
                    prior.
                    Many Jews still celebrate this holiday today by lighting candles on a menorah, or hanukkiah, which
                    is a candelabra with 9 arms. The shamesh, the candle used to light the others, is lit each day, plus
                    one additional candle per day of the holiday up to 8 on the last day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there are some arguments as to what constitutes lighting a menorah. For the halachos (laws)
                    of Shabbat, it is said that
                    turning on an incandescent light is similar to lighting a fire since the filament gets hot enough to
                    burn, and lighting fire on Shabbat is forbidden because it was a form of work done in the
                    mishkan (tabernacle) back in the times of the temple. Shabbat is supposed to be a day of rest, so no
                    work is allowed to be done that day.

                    This drasha (sermon) by Rabbi Katz from congregation Anshe Chesed in Linden, New Jersey goes over
                    the topic of using lightbulbs in an electric menorah,
                    and if that fulfills the requirement of actually lighting a menorah for Chanukah.
