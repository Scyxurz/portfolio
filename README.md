Projects I have created in the past

Stored in the docs folder are some projects I have created in college classes or the year following graduation

Some are currently broken, but have still been included so the code can be viewed.

The SMITEMS project has intentionally had my Hi-Rez API credentials removed from index.js for security purposes. The page won't pull from the API, but it has also been included for viewing the code.
