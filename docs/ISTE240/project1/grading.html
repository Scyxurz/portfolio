                I feel like my end product looks like a rushed job, but I did spend a lot of time on it. One of the
                biggest time-sinks, and something that I'm annoyed I still can't get working how I want it to work, is
                the dropdown navigation menu. It's almost exactly how I want it in desktop mode, but when shrinking the
                screen size to view the site as it would appear on mobile, I wanted to create a hamburger menu that
                could be opened and closed by clicking on it. I had paused implementation of the hamburger menu, as a
                different issue came up that I couldn't overcome. I want the menu to stick to the left side of the
                screen on mobile and take up the height of the screen, and clicking on elementsof the nav bar that would
                open a dropdown, like "Places," would either extend the menu allowing the user to scroll down, or would
                extend the menu to the right, blocking more of the screen but allowing easier navigation.
                <br><br>
                Ignoring that, I also had some issue getting images to be the correct size, which I think could be
                easily solved with just a bit more time to make sure they all have the same dimensions. I tried to have
                at least 1 or 2 images on every page, and a paragraph or 2 describing the area. Every page is consistent
                as they all rely on the same stylesheet, and although it doesn't look great visually, I'm pleased that
                most of it works as intended. One thing I enjoyed learning about was creating clickable areas on a map
                to bring the user to the page about that location. It currently has an issue where resizing the page
                makes finding the clickable spots harder as the coordinates are tied to image size, but I assume that
                can be fixed with JavaScript, although it may be beyond my current abilities.
                <br><br>
                There's also a warning that pops up when validating about using a header element inside an article tag,
                but considering how close to the deadline I'm submitting this I'll just try to remember to get back to
                it next time.
